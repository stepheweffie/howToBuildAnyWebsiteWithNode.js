Modules and NPM
===============

If you go to https://www.npmjs.org/ you will find all of the
popular JavaScript modules and how to download them super
quickly.

NPM(Node Package Manager) is automatically installed when you installed Node earilier.

NPM has 2 different ways of working:

1. local(default) = Node modules are installed & stored in a local folder called "node_modules". 
2. global = All Node modules are installed inside a shared folder and you keep only 1 version of each module. To install a Node module globally use the '-g' switch
