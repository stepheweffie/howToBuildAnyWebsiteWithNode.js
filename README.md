<b>Purpose of this repository</b>: Create the most up to date, engaging, easy to understand, & free

<h2>How to contribute to this book</h2>

1. Build something cool with Node.js that you think will be useful to others!
2. Fork this repo & add a new chapter explaining how you programmed the useful thing you made 
explaining the process as if you were talking to a 10 year old kid. You may want to read a chapter 
from the current book to get a feel for the level of simplicity & explanation I am looking for.
